# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a = 16
binary = bin(a)
print(binary)

```

## Output
<img width="1312" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b682cd73-0f6c-4f26-880d-62880b033b57" />

## Result
Thus To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions. Hence the code has been executed successfully.
