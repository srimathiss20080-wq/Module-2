# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

f = lambda x, y: x + y
print(f(a, b))
```

## Result
Thus To write a Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum. Hence the code has been executed successfully.
